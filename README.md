Welcome to the Semantic Search Project in Python! This project aims to implement a powerful semantic search engine that can retrieve relevant documents based on the semantic meaning of the user's query. The system leverages natural language processing techniques to understand the context and meaning behind the search terms, enabling more accurate and context-aware search results.

## Overview

Semantic search is an advanced search technique that goes beyond traditional keyword-based search methods. It focuses on understanding the intent of the search query and retrieving documents that are contextually relevant, even if they don't contain the exact keywords. This project utilizes Python and various NLP libraries to build a semantic search engine capable of handling a wide range of applications, from information retrieval to chatbots and more.

## Features

- Perform semantic search on a collection of documents.
- Support for various NLP techniques like word embeddings, sentence embeddings, and more.
- Easy-to-use interface for querying and retrieving relevant documents.
- Extensible and customizable architecture for advanced users.

## Installation

To get started with the Semantic Search Project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/semantic-search-project.git
cd semantic-search-project
```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

The project provides an easy-to-use API for semantic search. You can integrate it into your own applications or use it directly from the command line.

To perform a semantic search, you need to follow these steps:

1. Prepare a collection of documents or articles in a format supported by the search engine (e.g., JSON, CSV).

2. Preprocess the documents (e.g., tokenize, remove stopwords) if required.

3. Create a search index using the provided indexing tools.

4. Query the search index with your user's search input to retrieve relevant documents.

## Examples

Here's a simple example of how to use the semantic search engine:

```python
from semantic_search import SemanticSearch

# Assuming you have a list of documents 'documents' and a user query 'user_query'
documents = [...]  # List of dictionaries containing 'id' and 'content' fields
user_query = "How does photosynthesis work?"

# Create a SemanticSearch instance
search_engine = SemanticSearch(documents)

# Index the documents
search_engine.index_documents()

# Perform the semantic search
results = search_engine.search(user_query)

# Print the search results
for result in results:
    print(result['id'], result['score'])
```
